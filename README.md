# Background

I am a Team Lead with 3+ years of experince. I use GitHub primarily for training and to build small-ish personal projects.

# Projects

## COVID-19 Visualizer

This is a simple tool to visualize a number of metrics related to the COVID-19 pandemic (number of cases, number of vaccines delivered, number of deaths etc).

Repositories: [backend](https://github.com/theasjblog/covid19_package) and [frontend](https://github.com/theasjblog/covid19Visualizer_app).

Language: `R/RShiny`.

## TSS Planner

A tool to plan a multisport, tipically triathlon, training week using Joe Friel's TSS and Matt Fitzgerlad's 80/20 principles.

Repositories: [backend](https://github.com/theasjblog/tssPlanner_package) and [frontend](https://github.com/theasjblog/tssPlanner_app).

Language: `R/RShiny`.

## TCX Analyzer

A tool to analyze `.tcx` files from training devices (i.e. Garmin watches).

Repositories: [backend](https://github.com/theasjblog/tcx_package) and [frontend](https://github.com/theasjblog/tcx_app).

Language: `R/RShiny`.

### Future plans for TSS Planner and TCX Analyzer

These two tools are related. In the future, I plan to harmonise the objects underlying the two packges and to create a platform to plan and analyse trainig sessions and races. This will require:
- Possibly rewrite in `Python/JS`
- Create a database

## Sudoku solver

Yet another sudoku solver. The solution itself is based on Professor Thorsten Altenkirch recursion approach. The rest of the repository is a prototype to allow solving from a picture taken from a device. Currently it has been tested only on Microsoft Surface Go. Numbers recognition is based on a simple machine learning categorisation model. Future developing plans include adding neural network to better "read" the images.

Repository: [Juyter Notebook](https://github.com/theasjblog/sudokuSolver_py).

Language: `Python`
